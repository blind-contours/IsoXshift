@article{McCoy2023mediation,
abstract = {Mediation analysis in causal inference typically concentrates on one binary exposure, using deterministic interventions to split the average treatment effect into direct and indirect effects through a single mediator. Yet, real-world exposure scenarios often involve multiple continuous exposures impacting health outcomes through varied mediation pathways, which remain unknown a priori. Addressing this complexity, we introduce NOVAPathways, a methodological framework that identifies exposure-mediation pathways and yields unbiased estimates of direct and indirect effects when intervening on these pathways. By pairing data-adaptive target parameters with stochastic interventions, we offer a semi-parametric approach for estimating causal effects in the context of high-dimensional, continuous, binary, and categorical exposures and mediators. In our proposed cross-validation procedure, we apply sequential semi-parametric regressions to a parameter-generating fold of the data, discovering exposure-mediation pathways. We then use stochastic interventions on these pathways in an estimation fold of the data to construct efficient estimators of natural direct and indirect effects using flexible machine learning techniques. Our estimator proves to be asymptotically linear under conditions necessitating n to the negative quarter consistency of nuisance function estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate the square root n consistency of our estimator when the exposure is quantized, whereas for truly continuous data, approximations in numerical integration prevent square root n consistency. Our NOVAPathways framework, part of the open-source IsoXshift package in R, makes our proposed methodology for high-dimensional mediation analysis available to researchers, paving the way for the application of modified exposure policies which can delivery more informative statistical results for public policy.},

@article{Diaz2020a,
abstract = {Mediation analysis in causal inference has traditionally focused on binary exposures and deterministic interventions, and a decomposition of the average treatment effect in terms of direct and indirect effects. We present an analogous decomposition of the population intervention effect, defined through stochastic interventions on the exposure. Population intervention effects provide a generalized framework in which a variety of interesting causal contrasts can be defined, including effects for continuous and categorical exposures. We show that identification of direct and indirect effects for the population intervention effect requires weaker assumptions than its average treatment effect counterpart, under the assumption of no mediatorâ€“outcome confounders affected by exposure. In particular, identification of direct effects is guaranteed in experiments that randomize the exposure and the mediator. We propose various estimators of the direct and indirect effects, including substitution, reweighted and efficient estimators based on flexible regression techniques, allowing for multivariate mediators. Our efficient estimator is asymptotically linear under a condition requiring n1/4-consistency of certain regression functions. We perform a simulation study in which we assess the finite sample properties of our proposed estimators. We present the results of an illustrative study where we assess the effect of participation in a sports team on the body mass index among children, using mediators such as exercise habits, daily consumption of snacks and overweight status.},

@article{Hubbard2016,
abstract = {Consider one observes n i.i.d. copies of a random variable with a probability distribution that is known to be an element of a particular statistical model. In order to define our statistical target we partition the sample in V equal size sub-samples, and use this partitioning to define V splits in an estimation sample (one of the V subsamples) and corresponding complementary parameter-generating sample. For each of the V parameter-generating samples, we apply an algorithm that maps the sample to a statistical target parameter. We define our sample-split data adaptive statistical target parameter as the average of these V-sample specific target parameters. We present an estimator (and corresponding central limit theorem) of this type of data adaptive target parameter. This general methodology for generating data adaptive target parameters is demonstrated with a number of practical examples that highlight new opportunities for statistical learning from data. This new framework provides a rigorous statistical methodology for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis within the same data. Given that more research is becoming "data-driven", the theory developed within this paper provides a new impetus for a greater involvement of statistical inference into problems that are being increasingly addressed by clever, yet ad hoc pattern finding methods. To suggest such potential, and to verify the predictions of the theory, extensive simulation studies, along with a data analysis based on adaptively determined intervention rules are shown and give insight into how to structure such an approach. The results show that the data adaptive target parameter approach provides a general framework and resulting methodology for data-driven science.},

@article{Zheng2010,
abstract = {We consider a targeted maximum likelihood estimator of a path-wise differen- tiable parameter of the data generating distribution in a semi-parametric model based on observing n independent and identically distributed observations. The targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) uses V-fold sample splitting for the initial estimator in order to make the TMLE maximally robust in its bias re- duction step. We prove a general theorem that states asymptotic efficiency (and thereby regularity) of the targeted maximum likelihood estimator when the initial estimator is consistent and a second order term converges to zero in probability at a rate faster than the square root of the sample size, but no other meaningful conditions are needed. In particular, the conditions of this theorem allow the full utilization of loss based super learning to obtain the initial estimator. In particular, the theorem proves that first order efficient and unbiased estima- tion is enhanced in an important way by using adaptive estimators such as an super learner, thereby formally dealing with the concern that adaptive estimation might make it harder to construct valid confidence intervals. On the contrary, the theorem teaches us that to achieve first order efficiency and regularity, it is crucial to estimate the relevant parts of the true data generating distribution as good as possible. The theorem is applied to prove asymptotic efficiency of the targeted maximum likelihood estimator of the additive causal effect of a binary treatment on an outcome in a randomized controlled trial and in an observational study. Excellent finite sample performance of this estimator has been demonstrated in past articles (e.g.van der Laan et al. (September, 2009), Gruber and van der Laan (2010), Stitelman and van der Laan (2010), Petersen et al. (2010).},
