\usage{
tmle_exposhift(
  data_internal,
  Qn_scaled,

  Hn,
  fluctuation = "standard",
  eif_reg_type = c("hal", "glm"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_internal}{A \code{data.table} constructed internally by a call to
\code{expo_shift}. This contains most of the data required for computing the
targeted minimum loss (TML) estimator.}

\item{Qn_scaled}{An object providing the value of the outcome evaluated after
imposing min max scaling. This object is passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function for Q estimation.}

\item{Qn_unscaled}{An object providing the value of the outcome evaluated at the
natural value of the treatment that is not scaled. This object is passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function for Q estimation.}

\item{Hn}{An object providing values of the auxiliary ("clever")
covariate, constructed from the treatment mechanism and required for
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. This object should be passed
in after being constructed by a call to the clever covariate construction function.}

\item{fluctuation}{The method to be used in the submodel fluctuation step
(targeting step) to compute the TML estimator. The choices are "standard"
and "weighted" for where to place the auxiliary covariate in the logistic
tilting regression.}

\item{eif_reg_type}{Whether a flexible nonparametric function ought to be
used in the dimension-reduced nuisance regression of the targeting step for
the censored data case. By default, the method used is a nonparametric
regression based on the Highly Adaptive Lasso.
Set this to \code{"glm"} to instead use a simple linear regression model.
In this step, the efficient influence function (EIF) is regressed against
covariates contributing to the censoring mechanism (i.e., EIF ~ V | C = 1).}

\item{y}{Outcome variable name as a \code{character} string.}

\item{estimator}{A \code{character} string specifying the estimator to be used.
Currently, only "tmle" is supported.}

\item{delta}{A \code{numeric} value indicating the shift in the treatment to
be used in defining the target parameter. This is defined with respect to
the scale of the treatment (A).}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{txshift} containing the results of the
procedure to compute a TML estimate of the treatment shift parameter.
}
\description{
Targeted Minimum Loss Estimate of Counterfactual Mean under Stochastic Shift Intervention
}
\details{
This function implements the procedure to construct a targeted minimum loss estimate
(TMLE) of the counterfactual mean under a modified treatment policy that incorporates a
stochastic shift intervention.
